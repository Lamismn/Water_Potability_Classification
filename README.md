# Water_Potability_Classification
## Overview
This project aim is to determine the potability of water based on different readings of different quality metrics for 3276 samples of water, and shows the potability of each sample.

Water is a key element for life, many regions around the world suffer from clean water scarcity, which makes water potability one of the most crucial topics on earth. The aim of this study is to determine wether we could develop a machine learning model that could determine if the water is potable based on different characteristic readings.
### Background
The data used for this study is from a public dataset published on Kaggle.com, the dataset can be found in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability
